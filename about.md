&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to understand how things work.
I enjoy encountering a problem, something that I may know little about, and digging a hole 
to provide a contextual understanding of its domain and inner workings. I apply this interest 
to trying to understand most of the things in the universe. From mathematics to computational 
science, human behavior and my favorite hobby, off road motorcycles.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completed my master's degree in computer science 
in December of 2016. I was a full time student from 2014-2016. During that time, I was working as 
a graduate assistant conducting research on graphic image recognition. The research was for understanding 
the underlying message in a multimodal document such as a line chart, bar chart and pie chart. 
This experiment was similar to the technology in a tool called [Zanran](http://www.zanran.com/) 
and a subset of complete image recognition tools, such as [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/) 
and [Wolfram](https://www.imageidentify.com/). My role was to build a tool to predict the underlying 
message of an information graphic given in XML form. The most appealing part of the project was learning 
the machine learning pipeline and how to use machine learning tools, which came from my original interest 
in mathematics.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My current position is at Hilton where I work on the 
[Connected Room](https://stories.hilton.com/releases/hilton-introduces-confirmed-connecting-rooms) project.
