&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to understand how things work. This is a desire that is hard to paint a picture of with portfolios and projects. I enjoy encountering a problem, something that I may know little about, and digging a hole to provide a contextual understanding of its domain and inner workings. I apply this interest to trying to understand most of the things in the universe. From the traits of human behavior to mathematics and computational science all the way to my favorite hobby, motorcycles.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completed my master's degree in computer science in December of 2016. I was a full time student from 2014-2016. During that time, I was working as a graduate assistant conducting research on graphic image recognition. The research was for understanding the underlying message in a multimodal document such as a line chart, bar chart and pie chart. This experiment was similar to a tool called [Zanran](http://www.zanran.com/) and a subset of complete image recognition tools, such as  [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/) and [Wolfram](https://www.imageidentify.com/). I was tasked with building a tool to predict the underlying message of an information graphic given in XML form. The most appealing part of the project was learning how to use machine learning tools which came from my initial interest in mathematics.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the jobs I’ve held in the past were working as a math tutor at Mathnasium, working in machine and metal fabrication shops and as a motorcycle mechanic. How society goes about educating people with techniques to modify behavior, develop critical thinking and acquire knowledge is a topic where bureaucracy tends to rule over psychology. I find that you need to have a higher level of understanding in order to properly convey ideas and principles to another and that pushes me to develop a better understanding as well as become a better communicator.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I’m currently pursuing a software development role, my current position is an entrepreneurial repair role centered around off road motorcycles. Right to repair is a big interest of mine. Companies go to great lengths to prevent consumers from working on their product. This is done through copyright laws, supply chain monopolies, proprietary tools and limited documentation. Motorcycles are becoming more computer automated and this allows me to use my software knowledge, cnc machining, 3d printing and mechanical skills. It allows me to develop autonomy, provide more value and have a larger impact.
