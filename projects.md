&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercism is an open source learning platform that provides 
opportunity for people of all backgrounds by helping them develop their programming skills through code practice 
and mentorship. I enjoy working as a team to help build and maintain the 
[Java track](https://exercism.org/profiles/ericbalawejder). Some of the things I've helped build are the test 
runner, user interface features, documentation, test creation as well as responding to issues. Working on Exercism 
allows me to be apart of a team, enhance my communication skills with the varying time zones, and build a tool 
that provides educational value.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hash-match is a hashing tool. It is used to hash a string or 
compare the hashes of two files. It provides the option to specify the hashing algorithm to compare with other 
previous generated hashes. I wanted an all in one tool for creating hashes of Strings, files and comparison of 
them with a specified algorithm. Go is great for command line tools.

<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/ericbalawejder/password-generator">Password Generator</a></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A random [password generator](https://ericbalawejder.com/password/) 
that allows you to explicitly specify the types of characters present in the password. The goal was to deploy the 
app on a different platform, Digital Ocean, create the infrastructure to manage the ssl certificates, web server 
and deployment while making requests to it from this server, Github Pages.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy learning about cryptography and it's applications. 
This is an exploration of the Java Security API with basic implementations. I like end to end encryption and privacy
tools. The government doesnâ€™t have to destroy the entire Bill of Rights because they have private industry do it 
for them. I'm currently exploring [libsignal](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java) and working on
a messaging application for fun.

<p align="center"><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advent of Code is enjoyable because each exercise is presented 
as a story that requires comprehension of what needs to be found before attempting to solve. It also involves 
importing data from a file with varying amounts of preprocessing. The community is great on 
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), Twitter and most Slack channels as well. I enjoy learning new 
ways to solve problems while exploring advanced language features. I write my 
[though process](https://github.com/ericbalawejder/advent-of-code) throughout.
