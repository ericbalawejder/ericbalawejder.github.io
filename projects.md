&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercism is an open source learning platform that provides 
opportunity for people of all backgrounds by helping them develop their programming skills through code practice 
and mentorship. I enjoy working as a team to help build and maintain the 
[Java track](https://exercism.org/profiles/ericbalawejder). Some of the things I've helped build are the test runner, user interface features, documentation, 
test creation as well as responding to issues. Working on Exercism allows me to be apart of a team, enhance my 
asynchronous communication skills, and build a tool that provides educational value.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hash-match is a hashing tool. It is used to hash a string or 
compare the hashes of two files. It provides the option to specify the hashing algorithm to compare with other 
previous generated hashes. I wanted an all in one tool for creating hashes of Strings, files and comparison of 
them with a specified algorithm.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advent of Code is enjoyable because each exercise is presented 
as a story similar to business rules. It also involves importing data from a file, similar to receiving data from a 
database, with varying amounts of preprocessing. Small changes to the puzzles can lead to significantly different 
problems and solutions. The community is great on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), Twitter and most Slack channels. 
I enjoy learning new ways to solve problems while exploring advanced language features. I write my 
[though process](https://github.com/ericbalawejder/advent-of-code) throughout.
