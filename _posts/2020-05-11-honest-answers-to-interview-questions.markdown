I was scrolling Twitter the other night, and this ad popped up in my feed.

[monster.com/career-advice/article/100-Potential-Interview-Questions](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/100-Potential-Interview-Questions)

This was a well placed ad in response to the mass unemployement moving across the country from
the covid-19 fallout. The topic of interviewing will no doubt be a popular one in the coming times.
With a beer in hand, I decided to get some practice.


### Basic interview questions:

`1) Tell me about yourself.`<br>
My math degree taught me how to add. My CS degree gave me the knowledge to do fizzbuzz. My computer
security certificate showed me the difference between http and https and my research papers taught me
how to write a complete sentence when communicating. I'm confident I can bring my skills to this
company and help you solve your problems.

`2) What are your strengths?`<br>
I'm motivated to understand how things work.

`3) What are your weaknesses?`<br>
My shoulders.

`4) Why do you want this job?`<br>
I send out a bunch of resumes and only get a few replies. The illusion of choice. Here we are.

`5) Where would you like to be in your career five years from now?`<br>
To become experienced enought to move past selling my time for money. To be a part of a value
based role.

`6) What's your ideal company?`<br>
A company that values critical thinking at all levels.

`7) What attracted you to this company?`<br>
The reply to my application.

`8) Why should we hire you?`<br>
To avoid wasting more time.

`9) What did you like least about your last job?`<br>
Not learning anything from my work.

`10) When were you most satisfied in your job?`<br>
Working autonomously on a technical task that was important to the business.

`11) What can you do for us that other candidates can't?`<br>
I can do more Leetcode problems to commodify my labor and devalue myself more.

`12) What were the responsibilities of your last position?`<br>
It was an unrelated role. They involved under cutting other peoples labor. A race to the bottom
if you will.

`13) Why are you leaving your present job?`<br>
To enter a role that uses my education, grows my knowledge, pushes my ability to reason and challenges
my intellect.

`14) What do you know about this industry?`<br>
That interviewing for tech roles is nothing like the job.

`15) What do you know about our company?`<br>
It was difficult to understand what your company actually does after reading your entire website.
It's usually a cover for e-commerce work. 

`16) Are you willing to relocate?`<br>
If the price is right, Bob.

`17) Do you have any questions for me?`<br>
Using only this crusty old whiteboard marker with barely any ink, can you please code up the
implementation of quicksort for linked lists that is, apparently, so critical to you production
environment?

### Behavioral interview questions:

`18) What was the last project you led, and what was its outcome?`<br>
I led a research project during graduate school. Although the outcome of the tool wasn't 
spectacular, the process outcome was very valuable. Working as a team, adapting to different
personalities and sharing knowledge through out the project building process was very rewarding.
 
`19) Give me an example of a time that you felt you went above and beyond the call of duty at
work.`<br>
I blew right past that two beer limit on Friday afternoon.

`20) Can you describe a time when your work was criticized?`<br>
All the times I didn't go past that two beer limit on Friday afternoons. 

`21) Have you ever been on a team where someone was not pulling their own weight? How did you handle
it`<br>
This is often the case of being overwhelmed. I broke down the tasks into smaller parts and worked
together on the ones we could to help motivate everyone involved.

`22) Tell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?`<br>
Calmly tell them what they could do to improve and how I could help them. 

`23) What is your greatest failure, and what did you learn from it?`<br>
My greatest failure was not understanding how much blind luck actually effects your path in life.
I learned that nepotism will take you far.

`24) How do you handle working with people who annoy you?`<br>
By avoiding most interactions. You can't reason with toxic people about their behavior.

`25) If I were your supervisor and asked you to do something that you disagreed with, what would you
do?`<br> I would communicate my knowledge about the matter and express my dissent.

`26) What was the most difficult period in your life, and how did you deal with it?`<br>
The most difficult time in my life was trying to get past the gatekeeping mechanisms of the tech
industry. I handled it by learning that my skills were not holding me back. Most jobs are not advertised
and are filled by the people you know.
 
`27) Give me an example of a time you did something wrong. How did you handle it?`<br>
Doing something wrong isn't bad. It's only bad if you don't learn from it. Making mistakes
can be valuable learning experiences.  

`28) Tell me about a time where you had to deal with conflict on the job.`<br>
Most conflicts arise from poor communication and unrealist time constraints. "What do you mean
nine women can't produce a baby in one month?" 

`29) If you were at a business lunch and you ordered a rare steak and they brought it to you well done,
what would you do?`<br>
Eat it. I don't waste meat and don't like it when other people do.

`30) If you found out your company was doing something against the law, like fraud, what would you
do?`<br>
There is a war on people who speak truth to power. I would document my findings and present them to the
proper channels. Then, expect to be terminated and embrace it. 

`31) What assignment was too difficult for you, and how did you resolve the issue?`<br>
Any assignment I found too difficult, I immediately voiced my concern about not being able to complete
it. This provides the best course change with the least time wasted.

`32) What's the most difficult decision you've made in the last two years and how did you come to that
decision?`<br>
Leaving my last role and starting my current one. Uncertain financial planning made it difficult but
the risk was necessary in order to do what I want to do. 

`33) Describe how you would handle a situation if you were required to finish multiple tasks by the end
of the day, and there was no conceivable way that you could finish them.`<br>
I would have a conversation with my manager about how deadlines are arbitrary because changes are
complexity multipliers. Driving engineers to an arbitrary date is a value destroying mistake. On time, on budget, meets standards. Pick two.  

### Salary questions:

`34) What salary are you seeking?`<br>
I was always told to never be the first person to throw out a number. If the application form requires
input, I put $1. The idea is to waste as much of your time as possible. Then, get you to make me an
offer and then negotiate your low ball salary number into the market rate range found on
[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm) and [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/)
because it's too expensive for you to let me walk away.

`35) What's your salary history?`<br>
This is a common wage suppession question and is illegal in some states.

...looks at phone...

“The new law goes into effect on January 1, 2018. Assembly Bill 168 prohibits California employers from
asking about an applicant's prior salary. If an applicant asks, employers are also required to provide
a pay range for the job.”

`36) If I were to give you this salary you requested but let you write your job description for the next
year, what would it say?`<br>
Software engineer IV.

### Career development questions:

`37) What are you looking for in terms of career development?`<br>
To do the best work I can, for it's own sake. To be creative and not follow others. Not cutting
corners for efficiency. Say no to things I would rather not do and never push something I know is
defective. 

`38) How do you want to improve yourself in the next year?`<br>
Expand my knowledge and bank account balance.

`39) What kind of goals would you have in mind if you got this job?`<br>

`79) What's the most important thing you learned in school?`<br>
An education doesn’t lead to a career and hard work doesn’t lead to success. These are two fallacies of
academia. The idea that anything is possible if you work hard enough is unfortunately a dangerous
delusion. Life is more random than it seems and favorable outcomes are more often attributable to
making good bets rather than a good work ethic. Don’t sacrifice more than it’s worth. Nepotism,
networking and luck play a large role in the outcomes of our lives. You can do everything right and
still lose.
