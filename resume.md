&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy building backends and tools. End to end 
encryption and the business constraints interest me. Making technology easy to use for businesses is important.
Performance matters because all of your users don't have 5G or an M1 chip. I like to use functional programming 
where it makes sense. My skills are focused around the Java 17 ecosystem. Iâ€™m interested in backend, mobile 
development and info security for FTE and contract roles. My current position is an entrepreneurial repair role 
centered around the right to repair of off road motorcycles.
