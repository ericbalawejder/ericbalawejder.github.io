&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy working on difficult problems when building backends, developer 
tools and appreciate the ability to create complex SQL queries for analytics. Making technology easy to use for 
businesses is important. Performance matters because all of your users don't have 5G, an M1 chip or an endless cloud 
budget. I like to use functional programming where it makes sense. I'm a proponent of end to end encryption. My skills 
are focused around the Java 21 ecosystem.
