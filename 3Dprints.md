A collection of motorcycle tools. Most of these tools are available but I often design and print my own. The STL files are hosted on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).

<br>
This tool is for holding 12.5, 14, 16 and 18mm KYB and Showa cartridge and shock shaft rods. The rods use chrome, DLC, Kashima and other sensitive coatings that may scratch from metal holders. I recommend 100% infill for clamping force. [damper_rod_holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579504/files)
