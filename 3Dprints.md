A collection of motorcycle tools. Most of these tools are available but I often design and print 
my own. The STL files are hosted on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).

<br>
<br>
This [damper rod holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579504/files) tool is for holding 
12.5, 14, 16 and 18mm KYB and Showa cartridge and shock shaft rods. The rods use chrome, DLC, 
Kashima and other sensitive coatings that may scratch from metal holders. I recommend 100% infill 
for clamping force.

The [Bell Moto 9 Flex helmet mouthpiece clips](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4923048) break 
forcing you to buy the whole mouthpiece. These are the replaceable clips that are held in place 
with a small Phillips screw.

The [Motion Pro fork oil leveling tool syringe](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4923056) does not 
put enough pressure on the rubber sealing head. It tends to pop off during use. This syringe is 2mm 
larger at the sealing head mounting area.

This [chain block measuring tool](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4923104) is used to produce
a consistent chain slack measurement. It sits up against the swingarm chain guide. It is 58mm talls
and allows for an extra 3mm of slack for sand and silt build up in the chain that causes premature
wear and potential chain breakage.
